                Who made Christmas?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Christmas originated as a Christian holiday to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. The exact date of Jesus's birth isn't known, but the church in Rome chose December 25th in the early fourth century. This date coincided with existing pagan festivals celebrating the winter solstice, which made it easier for the new Christian celebration to be adopted.
            <br>
            Over time, Christmas has incorporated various traditions from different cultures, blending religious and secular elements. Today, it's celebrated by billions of people around the world, both as a religious observance and a cultural festivity.
