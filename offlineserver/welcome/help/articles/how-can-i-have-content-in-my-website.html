<br>
<p>If you learned about these three programming languages (or already), you can start making your free website in OfflineServer!</p>
<br>
<p>Put the files you want to have in a folder that you can remember the path of that folder. And start writing</p>
<br>
<p>Once you are finished with your code, make sure to save it. Next go to this link: http://admin.offlineserver.net/editor and log in with</p>
<br>
<p>your credentials, then go to settings > import file</p>
<br>
<p>There will be a input saying that it needs the file path to import it, type it in, and make sure instead of the back slashes, put in forward slashes.</p>
<br>
<p>If not, your file ain't going to make it to your website. Once you imported all of your files, are are all set now! Now you can make a hostname for your website or test it!</p>
