            New Features in OfflineServer Settings called "Reinstall OfflineServer", "Help with OfflineServer", "OfflineServer Security"
            <br>
            Made OfflineServer Servers more secure than ever, with login screens
            <br>
            Using JavaScript's LocalStorage
            <br>
            Sized the options a little in OfflineServer Settings

            Bugs:
            <br>
            The Bug is called The SSL Bug. Most of the time it randomly spams opening bat file windows. We will try to fix it in the next update.

            Bugs we found while doing this project:
            <br>
            When setting up the username and password, the bat file formats it wrongly, so we had to fix that a couple moments later, and it is working when we tested it.
